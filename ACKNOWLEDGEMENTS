Posititve Acknowledgement:

When RECEIVER's nreceive.py receives a bintranslatedbinaryout file that decrypts without errors or warnings, RECEIVER sends a mutually defined positive acknowledgement back
to SENDER.

As a suggested positive acknowledgement, use nsendit.py to send back the entire bintranslatedbinaryout file that was just decrypted. This could potentially create a false
positive if SENDER's nreceive.py is still running. As a rule to be safe, each end should have python3 nreceive.py always on, except when python3 nsendit.py is sending.

Negative Acknowledgement:

No response by RECEIVER means negative acknowledgement. A mutually agreed timeout at SENDER (e.g. 10 minutes from last packet sent) allows time for RECEIVER to compose an 
encrypted or plaintext, positive or negative acknowledgement. SENDER should attempt at least one more try if no response from RECEIVER and then waits 10 minutes after each. 

A short plaintext message back to the message encryptor to help describe a negative acknowledgement will remain mostly readable after any expected dropped or mis-sequenced
SYN packets in the reverse direction are received. "Received 579 of LENGTH 580 packets" or "Wrong Key. Unknown secret key for the gpg -r recipient used in encryption."
